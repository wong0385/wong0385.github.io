                    Both matcha and green tea are made from steamed tea leaves, with the main difference being the selection criteria and production process. 
                    About six weeks before harvesting, the tea trees used to make matcha are covered with a special cloth that blocks out the sunlight to darken the colour of the leaves. 
                    Only the tenderer, greener leaves at the top of the buds are plucked. 
                    After harvesting, the leaves are steamed to preserve their colour and nutrients and to prevent them from developing enzymes; green tea is mostly made by stir-frying, which is a quicker process but can easily damage the quality of the tea leaves.
                    After steaming, the matcha is dried in an air oven and then sorted. 
                    After sorting, the stems and buds are removed and refrigerated, and then the leaves are finely ground with a machine or mortar to make the matcha powder. 
                    Although green tea can be ground similarly, matcha is usually ground at a lower temperature and for a longer period, so the powder is usually finer.
