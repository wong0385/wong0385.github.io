                About Me
            </h1>
            <p>Hi there! This is Kei from Hong Kong. You can call me <em>Karina</em>. 
                Interactive Media Design is not my 1<sup>st</sup> post-secondary educational program.
                I studied <abbr title="Landscape Architecture">LA</abbr> as my degree program back in HK. 
                During my studies, visual communication skills weakened my performance. 
                It resulted in my visual presentation being inferior to the verbal one on each studio project. 
                It made me feel stressed, so I did not graduate.
            </p>
            <p>Interactive Media Design provided by Algonquin College covers a wide range of topics. 
                I believe that I will be able to gain a deeper understanding and comprehensive training in communicating with people through different mediums and visual presentations. 
                It is why I am here. 
                I <b>enjoy</b> all the classes so far, and I am glad I made the decision for enrolling this course.
            </p>

            <p>I would call myself <em>old-fashion</em>, because I prefer to create art pieces by hand-drawing rather than using software.
                This course is definitely a big challenge to me. But I am confident I can do it well.

            <p>Here is the photo I used for my student ID card. This is probably the only photo I have that capture my face. 
                Because I seldom take photos of myself.
